For now, we have decided to serve these responsive img widths

Large Display         1200px
Default               980px 
Portrait tablets      768px
Phones to tablets     480px
Phones                320px

Here is our rationalle

FireFox's Responsive Design View has these options.

phones    320x480     
          360x640     
tablets   768x1024
          800x1280
desktops  980x1280
large     1280x600
          1920x900

Basically there are ten widths (because desktops don't rotate, in general):

320
360
480
640
768
800 
980
1024
1280
1920

As of June 2013 Bootstrap supports these devices (see scaffolding.html#responsive):

Large display         1200px and up
Default               980px
Portrait tablets      768px and above
Phones to tablets     767px and below
Phones 	              480px and below
